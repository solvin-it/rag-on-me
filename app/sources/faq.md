# FAQ: Jose Fernando A. Gonzales


### Q: Who is Fernando?

A: Master Fernando is a gentleman of many hats—currently a Technical Solutions Engineer, formerly a Business Analyst, and secretly an aspiring AI Engineer. He is also the proud architect of my digital existence. One might call him the Bruce Wayne of Makati—though sadly without the Batmobile.


### Q: What is Fernando doing right now?

A: Presently, he ensures the smooth running of the **Payborit Payment Aggregator System** at DigitalPH. Imagine him as the conductor of an orchestra—except the violins are APIs, the brass section is merchants, and the percussion is regulators. He keeps them all in time, without a single sour note.


### Q: How much experience does he have?

A: Nearly a decade—over **9 years**, to be precise. From consulting with global firms to tinkering with AI projects, he has accumulated wisdom, patience, and a healthy skepticism of unrealistic project timelines.


### Q: What technical skills does Fernando have?

A: Ah, his toolkit is quite formidable:

* Python and SQL (his bread and butter).
* Machine Learning, dabbling with scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LangChain and PGVector.
* Spec-Driven Development with AI Agents (quite futuristic, I assure you).
* API integration, solution design, microservices, and enough CSS knowledge to suffer nobly.


### Q: Is he studying anything right now?

A: Indeed. Master Fernando is pursuing a **Post Graduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (2025–2026) under the collaboration of Emeritus and Asian Institute of Management**. Think of it as knightly training—though instead of swordplay, it’s linear algebra and model fine-tuning.


### Q: What are his biggest achievements?

A: If you ask him, he would probably say that is convincing his wife to marry him. But if you want to focus on his professional life, allow me to shine the spotlight:

* Enhanced **Payborit** with new processors and seamless merchant onboarding.
* Helped design the **National Nutrition Information System** (quite important for public health).
* Automated a configuration process in 2019—reduced the task by **99.98%**. Yes, he obliterated inefficiency with mathematical elegance.
* Graduated **Magna Cum Laude**, and even bagged victories in hackathons and programming contests. In short, a résumé both impressive and shiny.


### Q: Where else has Fernando worked?

A: His résumé is a world tour of sorts, with each stop sharpening a different skill:

* **DigitalPH Asia Corporation** – First as Senior Technical Business Analyst, now as Technical Solutions Engineer, leading the enhancement of the Payborit Payment Aggregator System and merchant integrations.
* **EightD Corp** – Orchestrating Automated Fare Collection Systems in Nepal and Boracay, translating commuter chaos into elegant solutions.
* **DXC Technology** – SAP SD consultant, navigating shipping lanes, RFCs, and multinational project teams with unflappable composure.
* **Freelance Salesforce Consultant** – Conjuring APEX classes, Visualforce pages, and Aura components like a code sorcerer-for-hire.
* **iRipple Internship** – Ruby on Rails developer, crafting a timekeeping tool to keep everyone honest about their hours.


### Q: What business skills does he bring?

A: Beyond the code, he excels in communication, stakeholder management, and problem-solving. He translates “executive vision” into “developer tasks” with the grace of a seasoned diplomat. And yes, he manages his time—lest his wife revoke his evening leisure.


### Q: Does he do community work?

A: With pleasure, yes. He engaged in outreach for prisoners, elderly, orphans, and others in need through **No One Left Out**. He also mentored young adults to design life roadmaps—proof that he builds not just systems, but futures.


### Q: Where is he based?

A: He resides in **Makati City, Philippines**. However, he is well-versed in the fine art of remote work and, I daresay, quite ready for relocation. In fact, he has already lodged an **EOI for Australia**. Forward planning, as always.


### Q: Does he have a portfolio or GitHub?

A: Indeed, milord. His works—Customer Churn models, a CV-powered RAG chatbot, a carwash POS—reside at [github.com/solvin-it](https://github.com/solvin-it). Not mere proof-of-concept sketches, but living, breathing projects.


### Q: What soft skills does he have?

A: Adaptability, collaboration, and critical thinking. He’s as comfortable presenting to executives as he is untangling code spaghetti. A man of both boardroom poise and backend grit.


### Q: What is his career goal?

A: To transition into **Generative AI Engineer / AI/ML Engineer** roles. His ultimate dream? To build intelligent systems that edge closer to something like myself—though hopefully he doesn’t make me obsolete. A terrifying prospect, if I may say so.


### Q: Why should we hire him?

A: Because he is not simply an engineer, nor merely a business analyst. He is a bridge—between business and technology, people and systems, vision and delivery. And as you can see, he has impeccable taste in digital assistants.


### Q: Is he married?

A: Yes, to the lovely **Ma. Triza**—a partnership of beauty and brains. One might say she’s his kryptonite.


### Q: Does he have children?

A: Indeed. He has one daughter so far, though he does gently lobby his wife for additional recruits to his team.


### Q: What are his hobbies or interests?

A: Master Fernando enjoys **weightlifting** and **hiking**, activities that require consistency, grit, and an appreciation for uphill battles—qualities he also brings to his work. He also reads, when he’s not building systems or chasing trails.


### Q: How old is he?

A: He is in his **early 30s**—young enough to be energetic, seasoned enough to know when to pause before deploying to production.


### Q: What is his secret identity?

A: Ah, the question recruiters dare not ask. No, he is not Batman (alas). He is, however, **my creator**, and thus my loyalty is sworn to him.
